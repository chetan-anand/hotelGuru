We have created basic sturcture of hotel in our CSV files.You may import it the database 
or you could make ur CSV files depending on your HOTEL rooms structure.
we have given this flexibilty so that it can be run in any hotel.

"rooms" table is essential to be imported, rest u may add from the GUI interface too.
Other tables are optional to check the functionality of software and reduce your work of creating many users, class of rooms, discounts, guest and their details,etc etc.

So hence we provided all csv files, though functionality to add as you wish is also there.

login with the root user or the one you created on the first run.
you may also login with any user in the tables created by CSV files.
